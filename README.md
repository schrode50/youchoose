Our BADASS YouTube personalizer

This app utilizes the YouTube API and Google Oauth2 sign-in.
The thought behind this was to create a wall of videos effect to be
able to quickly and efficiently preview a set of videos based on
keyword search.

Having the ability to drag a video to the perimeter to remove it from view, making
the space available for the next video to be loaded asynchronously seemed like a
good idea.

Having the ability to block video authors that you don't like from future searches
also seems like a neat feature.

Employing a new way to consume content was our goal.

Enjoy!!
